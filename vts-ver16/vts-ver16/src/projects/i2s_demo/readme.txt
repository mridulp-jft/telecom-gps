This sample code requires:

- TWR-KL46
- TWR-AUDIO-SGTL RevB1 (wiht on-board oscillator)

An audio source needs to be connected to the line-in on the TWR-AUDIO-SGTL. For the output, a set of headphones can be used or speakers connected to line-out.

Press SW4 to enable the SGTL5000 5-band GEQ, press it again to disable it.

Known issues:
Due to I2S lines not routed to the elevator on the TWR-KL46 revision A, a connector must be created from the socket to the TWR-AUDIO-SGTL signals.
