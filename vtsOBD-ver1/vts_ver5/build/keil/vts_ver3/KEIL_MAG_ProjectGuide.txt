DESCRIPTION:

	Demonstrates basic project outline and UART communication for FRDM KL26Z.

TESTED ON:

	- FRDM KL26Z

	- IAR EWARM 6.50.6

	- CodeWarrior 10.4

	- Keil uVision 4.71.2.0

	- PE Micro DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v106.SDA

	- Memory Targets:

		FLASH_128KB
		FLASH_64KB
		FLASH_32KB

REQUIREMENTS:

	- FRDM KL26Z development board running PEmicro Debug Application (See OPENSDAUG.pdf for instructions to install debug app.)

	- Terminal application with the ability to send raw HEX data. i.e., Hercules

	- Mini USB cable for OpenSDA debugging & powering the FRDM KL26Z 

SETUP:

	Terminal:
		- Open up Device Manager to check COM port name of 'OpenSDA - CDC Serial port'. e.g., COM1, COM2, etc..
		- Baudrate: 	115200 (Check 'freedom.h' macro 'TERMINAL_BAUD' for baudrate setting.)
		- Data size: 	8 bits
		- Parity:	none
		- Handshake:	OFF	(Called 'Flow control' in PuTTY, set to 'None'.)

BEHAVIOR:

	A message "*** Running the KEIL_MAG project ***" should appear in the terminal. Following that message the user can send
	characters to the board, and they will be echoed back to the terminal.		

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

	IAR: 	Make sure IAR and FREEDOM are defined in the preprocessor.

	Keil: 	Make sure KEIL, FREEDOM and CMSIS are defined in the preprocessor.

	CW: 	Make sure CW and FREEDOM are defined in the preprocessor.
